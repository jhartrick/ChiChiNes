# ChiChi
 Once I wrote a video game machine emulator in c# and implemented it in Silverlight**

 ^ fantastic clicking experience for Intenet Explorer's die hard fan base. ^
  
 Some time later I rewrote it in typescript and named it after my guinea pig.  
 
 I have improved compatibility a lot, and am aiming for full compatibility rather than the softer target of 'some games I like'.
 
I figured I would make it an angular component so it would be better suited to the needs of the modern Enterprise.
